# Is It T-Shirt Weather App 
An app that fetches data from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeather API</a> to display the current temperature and weather description of a city of your choice. If the temperature is higher than 18 degrees celsius, it's t-shirt weather. If not, keep the long-sleeves on! 

I created this as a .NET application with C# on the backend and React on the frontend, as those are the areas where I would like to practice and my aim was to make an API call on the backend and get the React frontend to chat to the backend.
